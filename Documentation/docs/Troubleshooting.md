None so far

## Other Issues

This program is definitely a "work in progress". I have made it as easy to use as possible, but there are always oversights to program development and some parts of it may not be as easy to use as it could be. 

If you have any issues with the program or you think there would be better/easier ways to use and implement things in the SUMELF program, write a message on the [SUMELF Github Issues page](https://github.com/geoffreyweal/SUMELF/issues). Feedback is very much welcome!
